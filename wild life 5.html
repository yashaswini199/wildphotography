Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species,
 but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild 
in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife 
can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests,
 plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed
 urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term 
in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by
 human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected 
by human activities.

Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife
 in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses.
 Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments.
 This includes such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and gerbils. 
Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times,
 concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest 
against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.
