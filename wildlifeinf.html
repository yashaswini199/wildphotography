<p>
Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species,
 but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild 
in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife 
can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests,
 plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed
 urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term 
in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by
 human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected 
by human activities.

Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife
 in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses.
 Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments.
 This includes such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and gerbils. 
Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times,
 concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest 
against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.

<h2>HISTORY:</h2>
<P>
In the early days of photography, it was difficult to get a photograph of wildlife due to 
slow lenses and the low sensitivity of photographic media. Earlier photos of animals were
usually pets, stuffed, and zoo animals. These included photos of lion cubs taken at the 
Bristol zoo in 1854 and in 1864, photos of the last Quagga by Frank Hayes. Wildlife
photography gained more traction when faster photography emulsions and quicker shutters 
came in the 1880s. Developments like these lead to photos such as the ones taken by German 
Ottomar Anschutz in 1884, the first shots of wild birds in action. In July 1906, National 
Geographic published its first wildlife photos. The photos were taken by George Shiras III,
a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania. Some of his photos were taken with the first wire-tripped camera traps.

<h2>DEFINATION<h2>
<p>
The world's three largest photography organisations, the Photographic Society of America, the 
Fédération Internationale de l'Art Photographique and the Royal Photographic Society have adopted 
a common definition for nature and wildlife photography to govern photography competitions, their 
respective presidents writing in a joint statement,The development of a common definition for 
nature and wildlife photography will be an important step in helping photographers, many of whom 
enter competitions internationally, know what the rules are. It will also provide organisers with
a very clear definition when they need to deal with the problem of ineligible images.
</p>
<h2>GEAR</h2>
<p>
Gear for wildlife photography is very specialized and uses different lenses and equipment than most other 
disciplines. Most wildlife lenses have a very long focal length between 150mm and 600mm, allowing the
photographer to get a tighter image filling the frame with their chosen subject. However, whilst the
majority of wildlife is shot with a telephoto lens, when a wide-angle lens is used it can provide striking 
shots of animals within their environment.
